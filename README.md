# example-policy-service

When X event occurs, do Y.

Generally, when do Y means send a command, but in this example it just logs a message to stdout. I did however include the code for sending a command commented out. I'll try to come up with a better example at some point, but the todo domain is pretty simple...

## Policies

### todo.initialized

Logs a message.
